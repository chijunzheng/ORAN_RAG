# Coding workflow preferences
- Actively try to re-organize standalone code scripts into its necessary folder directoy.
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality. Do not end the conversation without proper testing and ensuring feature works.
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might one affected by code changes
- Don't stop working until you fix the issue at hand.
